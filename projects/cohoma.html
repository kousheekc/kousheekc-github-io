            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <img src="../images/projects/Cohoma/cover.jpg" alt="">
            
            <p>
                This project was done during the Cohoma II challenge (hosted by the French Ministry of Defense and ArmÃ©e de Terre). 15 teams were formed consisting of 
                industrial partners, research labs, students from engineering schools, and startups. The objective of the challenge was to use aerial and ground robotic systems 
                in real world conditions to deactivate traps. I was the lead developer of the team Softe consisting of the University of Lille,
                Lynxdrone, and FAAR-PRONERGY. My roles were the development of 4 PX4 based autonomous drones, a long range communication system based around WiFi and radio and the development
                central Human Machine Interface for the simultaneous control of drones and mobile robots. The robotic platforms used ROS2 and the Nav2 stack for autonomous navigation.
                In addition, custom CNN based algorithms were developed for terrain traversability estimation from overhead views from the drone. Our team won the prize for technical 
                perseverance.
