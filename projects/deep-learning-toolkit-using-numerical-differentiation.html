          <h3>Project Overview</h3>

          <h3>Overview of Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Machine learning is a field that revolves around developing methods and algorithms to make computers act 
            intelligently without being explicitly programmed to do so. Acting intelligently usually consists of 
            classification of some unknown data or making predictions based on past data. There are three broad categories 
            for the types of machine learning algorithms:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>1. Supervised learning algorithms use labelled datasets to train a model that can be used eventually to 
            classify or make predictions from new unlabelled data points. Supervised learning algorithms can be further 
            divided into two categories: 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>a. Classification models: these models are used to classify the inputs into discrete groups. The output is 
            therefore a discrete probability distribution. An example for a classification problem is determining a 
            digit from an image of a handwritten digit.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>b. Regression models: these models are used to predict the output based on an unknown input, the output is 
            therefore continuous. An example for a regression problem is determining the cost of a house based on 
            various features of the house, such as area, location, floors etc.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>2. Unsupervised learning algorithms use unlabelled datasets to learn intrinsic patterns within the dataset. 
            These algorithms can be used for clustering applications and once the training process is complete, the model 
            can determine the cluster a new datapoint belongs to.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>3. Reinforcement learning algorithms learn a behavior policy that dictates how the model should act based on 
            observations the model detects in an environment. The model learns the policy based on rewards it receives from 
            the environment. Eventually the model learns to act in a way such that the cumulative reward it receives from 
            the environment is maximised.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The toolkit that I will be developing is targeted towards building and training supervised learning models. 
            Therefore the toolkit requires a dataset of input feature vectors along with the corresponding labels. 
            The toolkit is also designed to handle both classification and regression models. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Neural Network Representation</h3>
          <p>
            There are several clever mathematical tools and methods that can be used to build a supervised learning model. 
            However one of the most widely used and well known is the neural network, which is inspired by the functioning 
            of a biological brain. A neural network has two primary components:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            1. Neurons or nodes: the neurons in a neural network are responsible for summing the input signals that are 
            connected to it. In the context of machine learning, input signals are represented by real numbers. Apart 
            from summing, the neuron passes the sum through a nonlinear function. This is necessary because, in practise, 
            the relation between inputs and outputs is rarely linear, therefore nonlinear activation functions are required 
            to introduce nonlinearities into the neural network.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/projects/Deep Learning Toolkit using Numerical Differentiation/1.png" alt="">
          <p>
            2. Edges: edges are similar to synapses that are present in biological brains. The role of the edges of synapses 
            is to connect neurons together and allow signals to pass from one neuron to another. Apart from simply connecting 
            neurons the edges carry a weight and the signal is multiplied with the weight in the edge as it passes through.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/projects/Deep Learning Toolkit using Numerical Differentiation/2.png" alt="">
          <p>
            Neurons and edges can be connected together to form a neural network. Once a suitable architecture is constructed 
            using the neurons and edges, the neural network can be represented as a “black box” that takes an input and 
            produces an output. The propagation of the input signals through the levels of the neural network is called 
            forward propagation and the output can be generated using a tensor representation of all the weights of the 
            edges and the nonlinear functions that were used.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Initially the weights are randomly set. An input is provided and the output is compared to the desired output 
            from the labelled dataset and the weights are adjusted so that the inputs provide the right outputs. Therefore 
            the weights can represent dials which are tuned in the training process to output desired results. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Overview of the Training Process</h3>
          <p>
            The training begins by forward propagating a feature vector and obtaining the estimated output. The difference 
            between the estimated output and the desired output is called the loss. The objective is now to determine how to 
            update the parameters to reduce the loss. This is achieved by computing the gradient of the parameter tensor, 
            in other words, it's the partial derivative of the loss with respect to individual parameters while keeping the 
            other parameters fixed. Graphically, the gradient of a function outputs a vector pointing in the direction of 
            steepest ascent. Therefore the loss can be reduced by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient 
            vector. This is known as taking a gradient step. The training process can be summarised into the following steps:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Repeat for all the data points in the dataset:
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Compute the estimated output by forward propagation
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Compute loss using the estimated output and the desired output
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Compute the gradient tensor
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Update the parameters by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient tensor
          </p>

          <h3>Gradient Calculation</h3>
          <p>
            To calculate the gradient I have implemented 6 methods to numerically compute the derivative of a function at 
            a point with respect to a variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Forward difference
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Backward difference
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Three point endpoint 
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Three point midpoint
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Five point endpoint
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Five point midpoint
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            The following results show the training process while using the Iris flower classification dataset. The training 
            was done using all 6 methods of differentiation and was finally compared to a model built and trained on Pytorch.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As you can see from the results the differentiation formula that was used did not significantly affect the outcome 
            for this specific dataset. In comparison to a model trained in Pytorch, both performed with similar accuracies on 
            the training and testing datasets, however the Pytorch model converged within 20 epochs while the other model took 
            100 epochs to converge. In addition, the time taken to train one epoch was much shorter on the Pytorch model.
