            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <img src="../images/projects/Collaborative AGV Swarm for Smart Factory Operations/cover.jpg" alt="">

            <p>
                This project was done as part of the Robocup 2024 logistics league. This league represents a smart factory setting, where the goal is for a team of mobile robots to assemble products on demand, 
                using a set of production machines. The machines are based on the MPS - Production System provided by Festo. Overall, on a high-level, this culminates into an online, multi-agent planning and 
                scheduling problem with uncertain execution behavior. In addition to tackling a complex high-level problem, teams need to set up and maintain a full robotics stack that can handle navigation, 
                manipulation and perception. Two teams share a common factory floor. Each team comprises up to three autonomous robots which can produce using seven machines. Each robot builds on the standardized Festo Robotino robot platform 
                which can be extended individually with sensors and computing devices. The robots are cooperative.
            </p>

            <p>
                A central agent randomly generates product orders with varying configurations and delivery windows. These orders are communicated to the robot teams that need to derive a production schedule and to distribute the tasks among the team robots. 
                Hence the RCLL posts challenges related to autonomous navigation, multi-agent systems, planning, scheduling, manipulation and perception.
