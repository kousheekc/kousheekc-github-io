                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <div class="projects-image">

                <p>
                  The goal of this project was to successfully build an air hockey table from scratch using CAD and CAM tools at a low cost. 
                  We began with a feasibility study to ensure that we have the necessary parts and tools to build this project. We then used 
                  Fusion360 to design the various parts. Next, the parts were built using CAM tools such as a laser cutter and a 3D printer 
                  and we assembled the pieces to complete the build. Additionally, we fabricated a point tracking module using an Arduino 
                  which can be used to keep track of points during a game. Finally we tested the air hockey table by playing a game and 
                  the results were as expected, which proved the success of the project. This project won the First Prize in the 
                  Instructables Game Contest 2019.
                </p>
                <h2>Feasibility Study</h2>
                <div class="projects-image">
                  <img src="../assets/img/projects/DIY Low Cost Air Hockey Table/1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                  The primary cost of a traditional air hockey table is the blower system and since our objective was to keep the cost down 
                  we decided to use a vacuum cleaner with a blower option. This significantly reduced the cost of the project since we 
                  already had a vacuum cleaner. Next, we did some rough calculations with enough margin to determine whether the output 
                  pressure of the blower would be enough to cancel the force of gravity acting on the puck. We determined that a minimum 
                  of 5 holes on the playfield would need to be directly below the puck for the puck to be stable. The calculations proved 
                  that the blower was powerful enough to levitate a 30 gram puck. Therefore we concluded that this project was feasible with 
                  the parts that we had and proceeded to come up with a design.
                </p>
                <h2>Design on Fusion360</h2>
                <div class="projects-image">
                  <img src="../assets/img/projects/DIY Low Cost Air Hockey Table/2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                  The project consisted of multiple parts that had to fit together perfectly for the system to work flawlessly. We chose 
                  CAM tools to build the parts because these are the most precise manufacturing tools currently available. We used Fusion360 
                  to design the parts and they were later manufactured using a 3D printer and laser cutter.  
                </p>
                <h2>Fabrication</h2>
                <div class="projects-image">
                  <img src="../assets/img/projects/DIY Low Cost Air Hockey Table/3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                  The key components of the air hockey table were the frame, the playfield, the backboard and the air system. The frame was 
                  built using 1x3 inch planks of wood and the backboard was made from plywood. The playfield was lasercut and supported using 
                  wood blocks placed on the backboard. Next, we added slots for the two goals followed by the various aesthetic elements 
                  such as the lights and corner pieces. We then mounted the point tracking system which consisted of an Arduino 
                  microcontroller, an LCD screen and 2 push buttons. We completed the build by attaching the blower.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div class="projects-image">

                </div>
                <p>
                  Once we completed the build, we tested the air hockey table by playing a game. The results were better than expected 
                  and after testing for several more weeks, the parts held up successfully. The project was presented at the annual 
                  maker faire and we received great feedback from children and adults who enjoyed playing the game.
