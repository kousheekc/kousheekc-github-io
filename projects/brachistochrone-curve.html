          <h1>Brachistochrone Curve</h1>

          <p><strong>Skills: </strong>Fusion360, Digital Fabrication, Calculus of Variations, Arduino</p>
          <p><strong>Build Instructions: </strong><a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-Brachistochrone-Curve/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.instructables.com/The-Brachistochrone-Curve/</a></p>
          
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Brachistochrone Curve/cover.jpg" alt="">
          
          <p>
            We were fascinated by the brachistochrone curve from the day that we were introduced to the concept during one of our 
            calculus classes. The goal of this project was to make an apparatus to visually demonstrate the phenomena of fastest 
            descent so that it could be used during physics or maths classes for younger students. The pieces were designed in 
            CAD since precision was key and fabricated using a 3D printer and laser cutter. We decided to make 2 other random 
            curves to compare against the brachistochrone curve and rolled a marble down each of the curves to determine the curve 
            of fastest descent. We later added a timing module that could measure the time taken for each marble to reach the 
            finishing line. Finally we tested the apparatus in a classroom and received great feedback from the students and 
            professors. This project won the Grand Prize in the Instructables Classroom Science Contest 2019.

          <h3>Brachistochrone Problem Statement and Demonstration with Snellâ€™s Law</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Brachistochrone Curve/1.png" alt="">

          <p>
            The brachistochrone problem revolves around finding a curve that joins two points A and B that are at different elevations, 
            such that B is not directly below A, so that dropping a marble under the influence of a uniform gravitational field along 
            this path will reach B in the quickest time possible.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            One of the approaches for solving the brachistochrone problem that we particularly liked is to tackle the problem by 
            drawing analogies with Snell's Law. Snell's Law is used to describe the path that a beam of light would follow to get 
            from one point to another while transitioning through two different media, using Fermat's principle which says that 
            a beam of light will always take the quickest route. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            A free-falling object under the influence of the gravitational field can be compared to a beam of light transitioning 
            through changing media of lower refractive indices which correspond to the increase of speed as the object accelerates. 
            Each time that the beam of light encounters a new medium, the beam gets slightly deviated. The angle of this deviation 
            can be calculated using Snell's law. As one continues to add layers of reducing densities in front of the deviated beam 
            of light, the beam deviates more and more until the beam reaches the critical angle, where the beam has a total internal 
            reflection, the trajectory of the beam describes the brachistochrone curve. (the red curve in the diagram above)
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The brachistochrone curve is in fact a cycloid which is the curve traced by a point on the edge of a circular wheel as 
            the wheel rolls along a straight line without slipping. Thus if we need to draw the curve one can simply use the method 
            above to generate it. Another unique property of the curve is that a ball released from any point of the curve will take 
            exactly the same time to reach the bottom. The following steps describe the process of making a classroom experiment by 
            constructing a model.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Design and Fabrication of the Apparatus</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Brachistochrone Curve/2.png" alt="">
          <p>
            We designed the brachistochrone curve on Fusion360 along with 2 other curves, one that was steeper and the other just a 
            straight line. We created mounting pieces for the curves that allowed us to interchange curves if required. The pieces 
            were fabricated using a 3D printer and laser cutter. The frame was built out of 1x3 inch planks of wood. The timing 
            module consists of 3 limit switches, an arduino uno, an lcd screen and a push button. The push button starts the timer, 
            and the individual limit switches stop the respective timers when the marble knocks into it. The timings are then 
            displayed onto the lcd screen. 
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Brachistochrone Curve/3.jpg" alt="">
          
          <p>
            Once we completed the build, we tested the apparatus in a classroom. The timing module verifies the math and the marble 
            that rolls down the brachistochrone curve is the fastest, followed by the steepest curve and finally the straight line 
            path. The students and teacher enjoyed the experiment and we received great feedback for it.
