          <p><strong>Source Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/kousheekc/Trajectory-Following-Controller-using-Bezier-Curves-for-a-Differential-Drive-Robot" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kousheekc/Trajectory-Following-Controller-using-Bezier-Curves-for-a-Differential-Drive-Robot</a></p>
          
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Trajectory Following Controller using Bezier Curves for a Differential Drive Robot/cover.jpg" alt="">
          
          <p>
            Generating trajectories from user specified way-points is a key building block for many autonomous robotic pipelines. 
            In this work, two trajectory generation systems are implemented and tested on a scratch-built differential drive robotic 
            platform. The user specifies an ordered list of 2D coordinate points in the world space along with the respective heading 
            angles at those locations. The proposed system generates a trajectory that passes through each of the points while 
            maintaining the desired heading. Next, the system generates control signals comprising of linear and angular components 
            which are transmitted to the robot. The proposed approach is thoroughly tested on a scratch-built differential drive robot 
            demonstrating the suitability and robustness of the trajectory generation pipeline.

          <h3>Odometry Motion Model</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Trajectory Following Controller using Bezier Curves for a Differential Drive Robot/1.png" alt="">
          <p>
            The objective of the odometry motion model is to determine a sequence of rotations and translations to create a trajectory 
            between the current and desired poses. In the case of a differential drive system, a pose consists of 3 values: 
            the 2D coordinates (x and y) and the heading (theta) of the robot and the trajectory consists of 3 parts:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            1. A rotation on spot to align the robot with the next waypoint. <br>        
            2. A translation to move the robot to the next waypoint. <br>
            3. A rotation on spot to align the robot with the desired heading at the waypoint. <br>      
          </p>

          <h3>Bezier Curve Interpolation</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Trajectory Following Controller using Bezier Curves for a Differential Drive Robot/2.png" alt="">

          <p>
            The Bezier curve interpolation method can be used to generate a parametric cubic spline through a set of points with 
            additional constraints set by guide points. This can be used in the context of trajectory generation to create a path 
            through a set of waypoints. Setting the guide points appropriately (equidistant from the central point and aligned)
            generate a C2 continuous trajectory through the waypoints resulting in a smooth motion for the mobile robot. 
          </p>

          <h3>Hardware</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Trajectory Following Controller using Bezier Curves for a Differential Drive Robot/3.png" alt="">

          <p>
            A differential drive robotic platform was required to test the trajectory controller in real world conditions to verify 
            the overall performance of the system. Here is a list of parts and components used in the system.

            The following steps outline the start to finish process of the trajectory following system incorporated on the

          <br>
          
          <p>
            1. The operator or a higher level algorithm sets waypoints (x, y, theta) on the master computer <br>
            2. The master computer transmits the waypoints to the onboard computer through a socket connection <br>
            3. The onboard computer generates a time parametrized trajectory using the odometry motion model or the Bezier curve interpolation algorithm <br>
            4. A timer gets triggered <br>
            5. Instantaneous velocity commands (linear and angular) are calculated based on the time elapsed <br>
            6. The velocity command gets transmitted to the microcontroller through a serial communication interface <br>
            7. The wheel velocities are calculated using mobile robot kinematics <br>
            8. The microcontroller sends hardware signals to the actuators to spin at the required velocity <br>  
          </p>
       
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <img src="../images/projects/Trajectory Following Controller using Bezier Curves for a Differential Drive Robot/4.jpg" alt="">
          <p>
            Overall, the two trajectory following algorithms have been tested on a differential drive robotic platform built using off the 
            shelf parts and components and the performance of the two algorithms were evaluated. On the whole, the results suggest that the 
            algorithm that uses Bezier interpolation to generate a trajectory introduces fewer errors due to the C2 continuous properties 
            of the Bezier interpolation algorithm.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The system can be further improved by building a comprehensive user interface consisting of a map of the environment that 
            can be hosted on the master computer to intuitively set the waypoints and headings and transmit them to the robot. 
            Additionally, a closed loop velocity control system can be incorporated for the motors to account for disturbances and 
            skipped steps. Finally a lidar sensor and IMU can be added to the robotic platform to map the environment realtime and 
            perform simultaneous localization and mapping.
